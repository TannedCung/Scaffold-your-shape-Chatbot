    @tool("quick_response", description="""
    Provides immediate, casual responses for common queries like greetings, thanks, simple comments,
    general fitness questions, or motivation requests. This tool routes directly to END after responding,
    terminating the conversation flow (similar to how transfer tools route to other agents).
    
    Use this tool for:
    - Greetings (Hi, Hello, Hey)
    - Thanks/appreciation (Thank you, Thanks)
    - Simple comments (Great, Cool, Nice)
    - General fitness questions (How to build muscle?, What's a good workout?)
    - Motivation requests (Need motivation, Encourage me)
    - Casual interactions that don't require specialized agent processing
    
    Parameters:
    - query_type: Type of query (greeting, thanks, casual, general_fitness, motivation, comment)
    - user_query: The original user message
    - user_id: The ID of the user making the request
    - context: Any relevant conversation context (optional)
